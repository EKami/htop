Introduction
------------

This is `htop`, an interactive process viewer.
It requires `ncurses`. It is developed primarily on Linux,
but we also have code for running under FreeBSD and Mac OS X
(help and testing are wanted for these platforms!)

This software has evolved considerably over the years,
and is reasonably complete, but there is always room for improvement.

Comparison between `htop` and classic `top`
-------------------------------------------

* In `htop` you can scroll the list vertically and horizontally
  to see all processes and full command lines.
* In `top` you are subject to a delay for each unassigned
  key you press (especially annoying when multi-key escape
  sequences are triggered by accident).
* `htop` starts faster (`top` seems to collect data for a while
  before displaying anything).
* In `htop` you don't need to type the process number to
  kill a process, in `top` you do.
* In `htop` you don't need to type the process number or
  the priority value to renice a process, in `top` you do.
* In `htop` you can kill multiple processes at once.
* `top` is older, hence, more tested.

Compilation instructions
------------------------
You first need to install the `lm-sensors` program and autoreconf. On Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install lm-sensors dh-autoreconf
```
Then run:
```
sudo sensors-detect
```
To detect your motherboard sensors.
Then run:
```
sensors | grep -oP 'Physical.*?\+\K[0-9.]+'
```
If the command returns a temperature then you're good, if it returns
nothing fix your configuration. Run only `sensor` to see if it displays
your CPU core temp. If it does then the above command must be adapted to
the line 30 of linux/CPUTempMeter.c . For instance you may change it to: 
`sensors | grep -oP 'Package id 0.*?\\+\\K[0-9.]+'` (notice the `\` added to the grep command)

This program is distributed as a standard autotools-based package.
See the [INSTALL](/INSTALL) file for detailed instructions.

For compiling sources downloaded from the Git repository, run:

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

By default `make install` will install into `/usr/local`, for changing
the path use `./configure --prefix=/some/path`.

Then clear your previous htop configuration with:

    rm -rf ~/.config/htop/htoprc

See the manual page (`man htop`) or the on-line help ('F1' or 'h'
inside `htop`) for a list of supported key commands.

If not all keys work check your curses configuration.
